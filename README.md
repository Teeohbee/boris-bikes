#Boris bikes
##Week 1 Makers Academy

This was my first week's challenge as part of Makers Academy coding bootcamp

###Original Task

The original brief was as follows:

> Let's go back several years, to the days when there were no Boris Bikes. Imagine that you're a junior developer (congratulations! That was easy). Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of Docking Stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will run all the Docking Stations, simulate all the Bikes, and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality. They call it - guess what? - 'Boris' Bikes, and they're offering a tasty sum of money.


###Approach



###Things I Learned
* **Pairing** - This was my first real experience in pairing and was a real eye-opener for me. Changing pair partner each day allowed me to explore multiple perspectives, ideas & solutions around the same problem, something I found hugely beneficial when trying to understand a new concept.
* **Domain Models** - Prior to this week, my Ruby knowledge was focused around solving singular, logical problems. Boris Bikes introduced me to the concept of domain models and the larger picture of how software is actually put together.
